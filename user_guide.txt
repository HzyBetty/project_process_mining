USER GUIDE: ED Triage Intelligence & Flow Optimization Tool
===========================================================

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
This application is a decision-support tool for ED Triage Leads. 
It uses Process Mining to map patient flow, Machine Learning to 
predict admissions, and Monte Carlo simulations to model 
efficiency gains.

2. INSTALLATION (Technical Setup)
---------------------------------
To run this app, you must have Python 3.9 or higher installed.

Step A: Create a virtual environment (Recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

Step B: Install Dependencies
   Run the following command to install all required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. RUNNING THE APPLICATION
--------------------------
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing 'app.py'.
3. Execute the following command:
   streamlit run app.py
4. Your default web browser will open a new tab with the dashboard.

4. DATA REQUIREMENTS
--------------------
The app requires a CSV file with the following column headers:
- patient_id: Unique identifier for each patient.
- timestamp: The date/time of the event (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).
- event: The clinical step (e.g., Triage, Registration, Assessment).
- triage_code: Numerical urgency level (1-5).
- initial_zone: The area of the ED (e.g., Zone A, Fast Track).
- disposition_desc: Outcome (must contain 'Admit' for ML features).

5. HOW TO USE THE DASHBOARD
---------------------------
- STEP 1 (Upload): Use the sidebar to upload your Event Log CSV.
- STEP 2 (Filter): Select specific Triage Levels in the sidebar 
  to isolate high-acuity patient data.
- STEP 3 (Analyze Flow): Hover over the Process Map (Section 1) 
  to see volumes. Check Section 2 for safety protocol breaches.
- STEP 4 (Load Balance): In Section 3, view the Heatmap to 
  ensure 'Immediate' patients are not stuck in 'High Wait' zones.
- STEP 5 (Simulate): Use the slider in Section 5 to see how 
  reducing delays by a specific % would change your total ED stay.
- STEP 6 (Intervene): Use Section 6 to pick specific 'Red Flag' 
  patients for immediate clinical review.

6. TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------
- "IndexError": Ensure your triage levels follow the "Number - Name" 
  format or use the automated mapping built into the app.
- "Blank Screen": Check the terminal for errors; ensure your 
  CSV columns match the requirements in Section 4.
